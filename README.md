## Background & Projects

### Professional Background

I've been honing my skills as an intermediate software developer at a prominent FinTech company, focusing on architecting solutions using tech stacks like Ruby on Rails, Docker, and GCP Kubernetes. In my previous roles I've worked with technologies includeing .NET, ASP.NET Core, jQuery, ReactJS, Hooks, Redux and React Routing.

### Projects Highlights

#### Ongoing Project(Private Repo):

Over the past year, I have devoted my efforts to building a web-based application that serves as a sophisticated solution for facilitating bookings and streamlining the process for locum medical practitioners. This ambitious project features a robust Ruby on Rails back end, delivering secure and efficient data management. On the front end, I employed React to create a responsive and user-friendly interface, ensuring an optimal user experience.

In addition, I've implemented a Dockerized local development environment, which not only enhances the project's portability but also streamlines the development process. This comprehensive approach to application development showcases my ability to harness a diverse set of technologies to deliver a cutting-edge solution that addresses complex industry needs.
